# Async tasks

Welcome to this repository of asynchronous Python examples! 

Inside, you will find 5 tasks (examples) showcasing various features of the asyncio module and other Python concepts. 
Each task folder contains its own code and a dedicated README file that provides more details about its functionality.

## Task Overview and Links

### [Task 1](./task1/README.md)
  * Choose array fn (map/filter/filterMap/some/find/findIndex)
  * Prepare its callback based async counterpart
  * Prepare demo cases for the usage
  * Add new on-demend feature during review
    e.g.: Add support for debounce (if the task took less then X time to
    complete -- add an additional execution delay)

### [Task 2](./task2/README.md)
  * Prepare promise based alternative
  * Write use cases for the promise based solution
  * Write use cases for the async-await
  * Add new on-demend feature during review
    e.g.: Add support for parallelism

### [Task 3](./task3/README.md)
  * Integrate AbortController or other Cancallable approach

### [Task 4](./task4/README.md)
  * (Stream/AsyncIterator/Alternative) -- Ongoing processing of large data sets that do not fit in memory

### [Task 5](./task5/README.md)
  * (Observable/EventEmitter/Alternative) -- Reactive message based communication between entities
