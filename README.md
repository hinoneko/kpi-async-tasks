# Async tasks

Welcome to this repository of asynchronous Python examples! 

Inside, you will find 5 tasks (examples) showcasing various features of the asyncio module and other Python concepts. 
Each task folder contains its own code and a dedicated README file that provides more details about its functionality.

## Task Overviews

  Task 1
  * Choose array fn (map/filter/filterMap/some/find/findIndex)
  * Prepare its callback based async counterpart
  * Prepare demo cases for the usage
  * Add new on-demend feature during review
    e.g.: Add support for debounce (if the task took less then X time to
    complete -- add an additional execution delay)

  Task 2
  * Prepare promise based alternative
  * Write use cases for the promise based solution
  * Write use cases for the async-await
  * Add new on-demend feature during review
    e.g.: Add support for parallelism

  Task 3
  * Integrate AbortController or other Cancallable approach

  Task 4 
  * (Stream/AsyncIterator/Alternative) -- Ongoing processing of large data sets that do not fit in memory

  Task 5 
  * (Observable/EventEmitter/Alternative) -- Reactive message based communication between entities
